# Emotion-Driven Auth UI

An experimental authentication interface where **emotion is the input**.

A single emotion slider (Calm → Intense) controls the entire UI behavior in real time — including background gradients, animation speed, input focus feedback, button interactions, and transitions between Login and Signup.

## Features
- Emotion slider as the main UI controller
- Mood-based background gradients
- Dynamic animation speed & easing
- Micro-interactions for inputs and buttons
- Login / Signup toggle with preserved emotion state
- Auto-flow demo mode for presentations
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- No external libraries or dependencies

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Move the emotion slider to see the UI react

## Demo Mode (Auto Animation)
The project includes an optional auto-flow animation where emotions cycle automatically.
This is useful for demos, recordings, or presentations.

## Use Cases
- UI/UX inspiration
- Motion & interaction design demos
- Frontend animation experiments
- Authentication UI concepts
